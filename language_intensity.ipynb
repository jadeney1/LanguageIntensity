dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military', 'As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong

merely criminals', 'They are unlawful enemy combatants', 'And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are', 'In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefieldÑincluding the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi', 'So today, I am keeping another promise', 'I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis

leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come', 'Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all', 'Seong-hoÕs story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom', 'It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America', 'It was a small cluster of colonies
